# Phone Number Tracker
Made with Python, allows you to track any phone number from any country (with the country code itself). It will give you the information such as country, the city, phone provider company, and it'll validate the possiblity of the number.  

# You will need to install phonenumbers using pip:
```bash
pip install phonenumbers
```
Supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x (in the same codebase, with no 2to3 conversion needed).

# Usage
Start debugging with Python File configuration and it'll show you an input that you want to fill it with the phone number that you want to.
After you put the number that you've requested, it'll show you:

(Region/City)

Phone Provider Company

Region Info

Phone number is valid: True (if it's valid) / False (if it's invalid)

Phone number is possible: True (if it's possible) / False (if it's impossible)
